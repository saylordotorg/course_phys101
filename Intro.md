Course Syllabus for "PHYS101: Introduction to Mechanics"
--------------------------------------------------------

Physics 101 is the first course in the Introduction to Physics sequence.
In general, the quest of physics is to develop descriptions of the
natural world that correspond closely to actual observations. Given this
definition, the story behind everything in the universe, from rocks
falling to stars shining, is one of physics. In principle, the events of
the natural world represent no more than the interactions of the
elementary particles that comprise the material universe. In practice,
however, it turns out to be more complicated than that. As the system
under study becomes more and more complex, it becomes less and less
clear how the basic laws of physics account for the observations. Other
branches of science, such as chemistry or biology, are needed.  In
principle, biology is based on the laws of chemistry, and chemistry is
based on the laws of physics, but our ability to understand something as
complex as life in terms of the laws of physics is well beyond our
present knowledge. Physics is, however, the first rung on the ladder of
our understanding of the physical universe. In this course, we will
study physics from the ground up, learning the basic principles of
physical laws, their application to the behavior of objects, and the use
of the scientific method in driving advances in this knowledge. This
first of two courses (the subsequent course is Introduction to
Electromagnetism) will cover the area of physics known as classical
mechanics. Classical mechanics is the study of motion based on the
physics of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton. While mathematics is the
language of physics, you will only need to be familiar with high school
level algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. The small amount of
additional math and calculus that we need will be developed during the
course.

### Course Information

Welcome to PHYS101.  General information on this course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following resources:

-   The textbook to accompany this course is OpenStax College’s
    [*College
    Physics*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/PHYS101_OpenStaxCollege_College-Physics.pdf)*. *You
    may find it helpful to download the PDF version and save  the PDF
    file as it will be used throughout the entire course. Problems will
    be assigned from this text. These are extremely important as they
    will be similar to those on the final exams. Solutions to the
    problem sets  are available, but it is important that you make every
    effort to solve the problems before looking at the solutions.
    Getting the answers is not what is important.  It is more important
    that you understand how to go about finding the answers in a
    systematic way. The Student Solutions Manual for *College Physics*
    can be found
    [here](http://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-physics) under
    Learning Resources.
-   Additional  problems will be assigned from *[Calculus-Based
    Physics](http://www.anselm.edu/internet/physics/cbphysics/index.html) *by
    Jeffery W. Schnick. Please feel free to browse this text, but our
    use of the text will only be for
    [problems](http://www.anselm.edu/internet/physics/cbphysics/downloadsI/sacProblemsIa13.pdf)and
    their
    [solutions](http://www.anselm.edu/internet/physics/cbphysics/sacSolutionsI.html).
    Although there will be no readings assigned from this text, it may
    be useful to look at the appropriate sections of the text when
    working the problems, particularly if you get stuck.

    Animations”](http://faraday.physics.utoronto.ca/PVB/Harrison/Flash/)

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its readings and
lectures.  You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the problems assigned throughout the course.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of about 130
hours to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on it and each of its
subunits.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be
useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to
set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take approximately
6.75 hours.  Perhaps you can sit with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3.75 hours) on Monday night and subunit
1.2 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night.  Unit 2 should take you 13.25
hours to complete. Perhaps you can schedule time to complete subunit 2.1
(a total of 4 hours) on Wednesday  night; subunit 2.2 (a total of 2.75
hours) on Thursday night; etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Take comprehensive notes as you complete the
resources in this course.  It may also help to keep the problems you
solve in one notebook for easy reference.  These notes will serve as a
useful review as you prepare and study for the Final Exam.
