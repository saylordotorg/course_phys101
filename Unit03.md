**Unit 3: Kinematics in Two Dimensions** <span id="3"></span> 
*Most motions in nature follow curved paths rather than straight lines.
Motion along a curved path on a flat surface or a plane is
two-dimensional and thus described by two-dimensional kinematics.
Two-dimensional kinematics is a simple extension  of the one-dimensional
kinematics covered in the previous unit. This simple extension will
allow us to apply physics to many more situations, and it will also
yield unexpected insights about nature.*
