**Unit 2: Motion in a Straight Line** <span id="2"></span> 
*Our formal study of physics begins with* kinematics, *which is defined
as the* study of motion without considering its causes.  *The word
“kinematics” comes from a Greek term meaning “motion.”  In this unit, we
will study* *motion without worrying about what forces cause or change
it.  Such considerations come in later units.  In this unit, we will
examine the simplest type of motion – namely, motion along a straight
line, or one-dimensional motion.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Compare and contrast distance and displacement.
-   Define and distinguish between vector and scalar physical
    quantities.
-   Explain the relationship between instantaneous and average values
    for physical quantities.
-   Compare and contrast speed and velocity.
-   Solve 1-dinentional kinematics problems.
-   Describe the effects of gravity on an objects motion.
-   Calculate the position and velocity of an object in free fall.
-   Draw and interpret graphs for displacement and velocity as functions
    of time, and determine velocity and acceleration from them.
