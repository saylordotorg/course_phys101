**Unit 4: Dynamics** <span id="4"></span> 
*The study of motion is kinematics, which*  *describes* *the way objects
move, their velocity, and their acceleration.* *Dynamicsconsider the
forces that affect the motion of moving objects. Newton’s laws of motion
are the foundation of dynamics. These laws provide examples of the
breadth and simplicity of principles under which nature functions. They
are also universal laws in that they apply to similar situations on
Earth as well as in space.*
