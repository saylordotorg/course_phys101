**Unit 9: Angular Momentum** <span id="9"></span> 
*Why do tornadoes spin so rapidly? The answer is that the air masses
that produce tornadoes are themselves rotating, and when the radii of
the air masses decrease, their rate of rotation increases. An ice skater
increases her spin in an exactly analogous way. The skater starts her
rotation with outstretched limbs and increases her spin by pulling them
in toward her body. The same physics describes the spin of a skater and
the wrenching force of a tornado. Clearly, force, energy, and power are
associated with rotational motion. These and other aspects of rotational
motion are covered in this unit. We will see that all important aspects
of rotational motion either have already been defined for linear motion
or have exact analogs in linear motion.*
