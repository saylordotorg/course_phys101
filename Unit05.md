**Unit 5: Circular Motion and Gravity** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we will study the simplest form of curved motion:*
*uniform circular motion, or motion in a circular path at constant
speed. In some ways, this unit is a continuation of* *the previous unit
on dynamics, but we will introduce new concepts such as angular velocity
and acceleration, centripetal force, and the force of gravity.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 15 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Compare and contrast the physical properties associated with linear
    motion and rotational motion.
-   Explain why an object moving at a constant speed in a circle is
    accelerating.
-   Describe Newton’s law of gravity in words.
-   Solve problems involving planets and satellites.
-   Explain what is meant when an astronaut in earth orbit is described
    as being “weightless.”
