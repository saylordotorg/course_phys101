**Unit 6: Work and Energy** <span id="6"></span> 
*Energy is the capacity of a physical system to perform work. It* *plays
an essential role both in everyday events and in scientific phenomena.
You can probably  name many forms of energy from that provided by our
foods to the energy we use to run our cars to the sunlight that warms us
on the beach. Not only does energy have many interesting forms, but it
is involved in almost all phenomena and is one of the most important
concepts of physics.*  
    
 *Energy can change forms, but it cannot appear from nothing or
disappear without a trace. Thus, energy is one of a handful of physical
quantities that we say is conserved.*
