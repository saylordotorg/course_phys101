**Unit 8: Statics and Torque** <span id="8"></span> 
*What might desks, bridges, buildings, trees, and mountains have in
common – at least in the eyes of a physicist? The answer is that they
are ordinarily motionless relative to the Earth. Thus, their
acceleration in the Earth frame of reference is zero. Newton’s second
law states that net* F = ma*,so the net external force is zero on all
stationary objects and for all objects moving at constant velocity.
There are forces acting, but they are balanced. That is, the forces are
in* *equilibrium.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 8.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.1: 3.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.2: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.3: 2.5 hours

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define the conditions necessary for a rigid body to be in
    equilibrium.
-   Define torque remembering that it is a vector physical quantity.
-   Solve statics problems.

     Instructions: Read sections 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 of “Chapter 9:
    Statics and Torque” (pages 289 to 298).  Look over the corresponding
    conceptual questions on page 310 to test your understanding of the
    sections.  Work on solving problems 1, 6, and 14 on pages 312 and
    313. The solutions are in the Student Solution Manual found
    [here](http://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-physics) under
    Learning Resources, but make a serious attempt to solve them before
    looking at the solutions.  
      
     Reading these sections and completing the problems should take
    approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.

     Instructions: This video discusses torque as a cross product of the
    lever arm and the force vector and illustrates how the direction of
    the torque is related to the directions of the lever arm and the
    force.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take you
    approximately 30 minutes.
