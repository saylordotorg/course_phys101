**Unit 1: Introduction to Physics** <span id="1"></span> 
*Our first step in this course is to gain a basic understanding of the
language and analytical techniques that are specific to physics.  This
unit will include a brief outline of physics and the scientific method,
measurement units and scientific notation, and the concepts of
significant figures, order-of-magnitude estimates, and scaling.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 6.75 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 3.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 3 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Explain the difference between a theory and a law.
-   Perform unit conversions using both metric and traditional U.S.
    units.
-   Write numbers expressed in decimals as scientific notation and write
    numbers expressed in scientific notations as decimals.
-   Solve problems with the values of the most common metric prefixes.

    Physics](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/PHYS101_OpenStaxCollege_College-Physics.pdf) *(PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read the Preface and sections 1.1 and 1.2 of “Chapter
    1: Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics,” on pages 7 to
    24. Look over the corresponding conceptual questions to test your
    understanding of the sections. Work on solving problems 4 and 10 on
    page 33. The solutions are in the Student Solution Manual found
    [here](http://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-physics) under
    Learning Resources, but make a serious attempt to solve the problems
    before looking at the solutions. Hint: For question 10, assume that
    the orbit is perfectly circular and recall that circumference can be
    found by multiplying the distance x 2 pi.  
      
     Reading this section and completing the problems should take
    approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.
