**Unit 7: Momentum and Collisions** <span id="7"></span> 
*We use the term momentum in various ways in everyday language. We speak
of sports teams gaining and maintaining the momentum to win. Generally,
momentum implies a tendency to continue on course – to move in the same
direction – and is associated with mass and velocity. Momentum has its
most important application in analyzing collision problems, and, like
energy, is important because it is conserved. Only a few physical
quantities are conserved in nature, and studying them yields fundamental
insight into how nature works, as we shall see in our study of
momentum.*
